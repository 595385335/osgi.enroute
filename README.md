OSGi enRoute Bundles</h1>

This workspace repository contains the bundles that had to be developed for OSGi enRoute because such bundles did not exist in any open source project. These bundles implement services defined in the [OSGi enRoute APIs] and/or provide common functions. 

All bundles are licensed ASL 2.0 but can depend on non ASL code.

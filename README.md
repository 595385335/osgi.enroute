# OSGi enRoute Base Profile

The [OSGi enRoute][enroute] project provides a programming model of OSGi applications. The OSGi specifications provide a powerful and solid platform for component oriented programming but by their nature lack ease of use, especially for newcomers to get started.

This project contains bundles providing the API for the OSGi enRoute base profile. The base profile establishes a runtime that contains a minimal set of services that can be used as a base for applications.

When started, it will bind to port 29998 and listens for incoming requests. When this port is accessed, it will open a link that allows it to act as an OSGi management agent that is remotely controlled. When this connection is closed, it will remove all bundles that were installed through this connection. The protocol is highly optimized to make this also work for small devices and slow connections.","errors":1,"groupId":"osgi","md5":"2EDE2508483856E4AC6199FE9BC62594","name":"biz.aQute.remote.agent","phase":"STAGING","qualifier":"201505081938","revision":"C7F70D8DB21E98BD8C503B24B60059079563F5CF","size":260723,"urls":["https://bndtools.ci.cloudbees.com/job/bnd.master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/bundles/biz.aQute.remote.agent/biz.aQute.remote.agent-3.0.0.jar"],"version":"3.0.0.201505081938"

This JAR contains a Launcher-Plugin. This plugin is found when you put this JAR on the -runpath of a launch specification in either a bndrun or bnd file. This launcher will read the -runremote header and contact a remote agent. The remote agent can be either a biz.aQute.remote.main, which will run as main, or a biz.aQute.remote.agent, which will run as a bundle. This JAR contains the agent so if the remote agent is a main then it will install the agent in this JAR.","errors":2,"groupId":"osgi","md5":"5ABA3AE243CD0677896D96BC045F2936","name":"biz.aQute.remote.launcher","phase":"STAGING","qualifier":"201505081938","revision":"75C139D595BDB8C8306AEDAE1595E5A1B8FDD9E0","size":289457,"urls":["https://bndtools.ci.cloudbees.com/job/bnd.master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/bundles/biz.aQute.remote.launcher/biz.aQute.remote.launcher-3.0.0.jar"],"version":"3.0.0.201505081938"

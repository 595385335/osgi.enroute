# aQute Twitter Bootstrap

## Problem

You want to use [Twitter Bootstrap][1] version ${version;===;${Bundle-Version}} in your OSGi application.

## Description

'Sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.' Ok,
that is the text on their web site. This bundle wraps all the components of a standard Bootstrap distribution. 
This includes ${lsr;static/twitter/bootstrap}.

The resources are available under the following prefix:

        /twitter/bootstrap/3

Therefore, the main bootstrap CSS file is available as `/twitter/bootstrap/3/css/bootstrap.css`. 

The version of this bundle will closely track the Bootstrap version.
